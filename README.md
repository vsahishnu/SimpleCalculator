This is my 3rd app in Kotlin. Important things I learnt/tried on this one:
(1) 1st time trying Linear Layout. Really suggest Constraint Layout over Linear Layout for sure. Should have used Table Layout.
(2) 1st time adding a new plugin. By adding this plugin, I can directly access components on activity_main.xml from MainActivity.kt. Very helpful for this particular project.Layout

(Plugin added:

apply plugin : "kotlin-android"

apply plugin : "kotlin-android-extensions"

)
